    "bio": "Nina Bangs was born in San Antonio, but spent most of her life in New Jersey. Somewhere between California and Texas she grew addicted to romance novels and cats. Before settling down to a teaching career, she dabbled in a variety of jobs ranging from working with Arabian horses to singing in Irish pubs. When she decided to try writing her own romances, the USA Today bestselling author made sure a cat crept into each of her stories. She lives near Galveston, Texas, with her loved cat, Abby.",
