In addition to writing The Magic of the Unicorn, The Throne of Zeus, and The Trumpet of Terror, she has written one other book in the original Choose Your Own Adventure series, two children's books for the Smithsonian Institution, and many magazine articles, mostly about textiles. She has directed community schools, led a mayor's office, studied Chinese and lived in China, and finally got her dream job-teaching English to adult immigrants. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with her husband, John. [source](https://www.cyoa.com/pages/deborah-lerme-goodman)"
