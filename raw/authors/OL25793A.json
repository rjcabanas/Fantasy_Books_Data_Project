        "value": "Bernard Cornwell (born February 23, 1944) is an English author of historical novels, known for his meticulous research and engaging storytelling. Born in London, England, to a Canadian airman father and a mother in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, he was adopted by a family in Essex belonging to the Peculiar People sect. Cornwell attended London University and worked as a teacher before joining the BBC, where he spent a decade, eventually becoming Head of Current Affairs in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nBernard Cornwell is renowned for his long-running series of novels, including the *Sharpe* series about Napoleonic Wars rifleman Richard Sharpe, the *Saxon Stories* (also known as *The Last Kingdom* series), which explores the unification of England, the *Warlord Chronicles* set in Arthurian Britain, and the *Grail Quest* series, which delves into a 14th-century search for the Holy Grail during the Hundred Years' War. Cornwell has written historical novels primarily based on English history, in five series, and one series of contemporary thriller novels. A notable feature of his historical novels is an end note on how they match or differ from history. He has also written a nonfiction book on the battle of Waterloo. Three of his historical novel series have been adapted for television: the *Sharpe* series by ITV, *The Last Kingdom* by BBC, and *The Winter King* for MGM+.\r\n\r\n([Source][1])\r\n\r\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Cornwell"
