        "value": "Nina Bruhns was born in Canada, but grew up in California, USA. With Danish ancestry, she credits her only Hungarian gypsy great-grandfather for her great love of adventure. She has lived and traveled all over the world, including a six-year stint in Sweden. She has two graduate degrees in archeology with a specialty in Egyptology, and she has been on scientific expeditions from California to Spain to Egypt and Sudan. She speaks four languages and writes a mean hieroglyphic!\r\n\r\nBut her first love has always been writing. For her, writing for Silhouette Books is the ultimate adventure! Drawing on her many experiences gives her stories a colorful dimension and allows her to create settings and characters out of the ordinary. She also wrote erotic romances as Nikita Black. She has won numerous awards for her previous titles, including a prestigious National Readers\u2019 Choice Award, two Daphne DuMaurier Awards of Excellence for Overall Best Romantic Suspense of the year, five Dorothy Parker Awards and two Golden Hearts Awards, among many others. She currently resides in Charleston, South Carolina, with her husband and three children. She loves to hear from her readers, and can be reached at P.O. Box 2216, Summerville, SC 29484-2216."
