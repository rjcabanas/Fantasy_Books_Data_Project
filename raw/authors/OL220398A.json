    "bio": "Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer was an American author, principally known for his award-winning science fiction and fantasy novels and short stories.\r\n\r\nFarmer is best known for his sequences of novel \u2014 especially the World of Tiers (1965\u201393) and Riverworld (1971\u201383) series. He is noted for the pioneering use of sexual and religious themes in his work, his fascination for \u2014 and reworking of \u2014 the lore of celebrated pulp heroes, and occasional tongue-in-cheek pseudonymous works written as if by fictional characters.\r\n\r\nPhilip Jos\u00e9 Farmer is also well known for remixing classic fictional characters, worlds, and both real and fake authors. This is epitomized with his Wold Newton family group of books that tie all classic fictional characters together as real people and blood relatives resulting from an alien conspiracy; his works such as The Other Log of Phileas Fogg and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life make Farmer the ultimate grandfather of the modern literary mashup. - Wikipedia",
