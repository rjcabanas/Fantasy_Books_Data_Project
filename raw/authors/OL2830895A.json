        "value": "Patrick Rothfuss (born June 6, 1973) is an American author, best known for his epic fantasy series *The Kingkiller Chronicle*. Born in Madison, Wisconsin, he matriculated at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, initially studying chemical engineering before switching to English.\r\n\r\nRothfuss spent nearly a decade working on his debut novel, [*The Name of the Wind*][1], which was published in 2007 to critical acclaim. The novel won the Quill Award and became a New York Times Bestseller. The success of his first book allowed him to focus on writing full-time, leading to the publication of the second book in the series, [*The Wise Man's Fear*][2], in 2011, which also topped the New York Times Bestseller list.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his writing, Rothfuss founded Worldbuilders, a charity fundraiser.\r\n\r\n([Source][3])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8479867W\r\n  [2]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8479869W\r\n  [3]: https://patrickrothfuss.com/content/author.html"
