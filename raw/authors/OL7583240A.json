As the ideas filled my head, I had to find a way to let them out.\r\n\r\nWhether it is scifi, fantasy, mystery, or poetry, you'll see all kinds from me. Relationships are the keys to all stories. As any good writer will tell you, \"There are no new stories, only different details in the telling.\""
