He spent his childhood at several family properties, including Dunstall Priory in Shoreham, Kent, Dunsany Castle in County Meath, as wells as other family homes such as in London.

Their child, Randal, was born in 1906.\r\n\r\nEdward Plunkett was a writer and dramatist, notable for his work, mostly in fantasy, which he published under the name Lord Dunsany.
