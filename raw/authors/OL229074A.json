    "bio": "Lynn Kurland is a best-selling American author of historical, time travel, and fantasy romance novels. The characters in most of her books all belong to one of three extended families (Macleod, McKinnon, de Piaget) and her love scenes are not as explicit as many other popular romances.\r\n\r\nHer first attempts at writing came when she was five years old and living in Hawaii. Her series of short stories featured a young man who encountered all sorts of trouble. After she moved to the mainland U.S. a short time later, she put aside her interest in writing to focus on music. Kurland always loved to read, though, and in college was introduced to romance novels. She soon decided to write her own novel. *Stardust of Yesterday* was published in 1996, winning two RITA awards. To date, she has published twenty-nine full-length novels and eight novellas, one of which won a RITA.\r\nSource: Wikipedia\r\n\r\n*Note:* The books can be read chronologically, or in publication order.
