        "value": "Glen Cook (born July 9, 1944) is an American writer of fantasy and science fiction, best known for his series *The Black Company*, a dark military fantasy that follows the adventures of an elite mercenary unit, and *Garrett P.I.* about a hardboiled detective in a fantasy world, blending elements of mystery and fantasy. Born in New York City, he grew up in northern California and served in the U.S. Navy from 1962 to 1972. He attended the Clarion Writer's Workshop in 1970, which helped launch his writing career. His first published novel, [*The Heirs of Babylon*][4], was published in 1972. After his military service, Cook worked at a General Motors assembly plant while writing prolifically. His works are celebrated for their gritty realism and historical complexity, influencing many in the fantasy genre. [Steven Erikson][5] has noted that Cook's work significantly impacted the genre by removing the stereotypes and cliches that were previously inherent in it, and introducing real, human characters and believable situations. He resides near St. Louis, Missouri.\r\n\r\n(Sources:[1][1],[2][2],[3][3])\r\n\r\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Cook\r\n[2]: https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Glen-Cook/biography.html\r\n[3]: https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13026.Glen_Cook\r\n\r\n[4]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17597447W\r\n[5]: https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL1394250A"
