    "bio": "Anya Bast grew up in Minnesota, USA, and still favors the colder climates. After high school she moved to the southeast United States where she attended college. While in graduate school she sold her first book and decide to pursue her lifelong dream of writing instead of a career in Psychology. Today is the New York Times bestselling author of numerous novels of romance-erotic fiction, mostly all paranormal.\r\n\r\nAnya lives in the country with her husband, daughter, eight cats, a dog, and an odd assortment of rescued animals. Somewhat reclusive by nature, she can be drawn out with a good bottle of red wine, classic movies, or good music. When she\u2019s not writing, she can be found trying to grow organic vegetables, shopping in thrift stores for that perfect piece of clothing, or dreaming about travel to some faraway country.",
