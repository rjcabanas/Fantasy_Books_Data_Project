    "bio": "Susanna Mary Clarke (born 1 November 1959) is an English author known for her debut novel *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell* (2004), a Hugo Award-winning alternative history. Clarke began *Jonathan Strange* in 1993 and worked on it during her spare time. For the next decade, she published short stories from the *Strange* universe, but it was not until 2003 that Bloomsbury bought her manuscript and began work on its publication. The novel became a best-seller. \r\n\r\n**Source**: [Susanna Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_Clarke) on Wikipedia.",
