    "bio": "Montague Rhodes James (1 August 1862 \u2013 12 June 1936) was an English author, medievalist scholar and provost of King's College, Cambridge (1905\u201318), and of Eton College (1918\u201336). He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge (1913\u201315).\r\n\r\nThough James's work as a medievalist and scholar is still highly regarded, he is best remembered for his ghost stories, which some regard as among the best in the genre. James redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal Gothic clich\u00e9s of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings. However, James's protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests. Accordingly, he is known as the originator of the \"antiquarian ghost story\".\r\n\r\n**Source**: [M. R.
