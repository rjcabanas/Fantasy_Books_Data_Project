    "bio": "Rose Impey lives in a small village in Leicestershire, U.K. She is highly regarded as a writer of books for children of all ages. It was her experience of telling stories in school as a teacher that led to her starting to write them down. Rose has a deep love and extensive knowledge of fairy and folk tales. For the Fairy Tales series (also available in a collection called The Orchard Book of Fairy Tales) and for the Twice Upon a Time series she thoroughly researched the stories of Grimm, Perrault and Joseph Jacobs before retelling them in her own spirited, direct and authoritative way. \r\nSource: http://www.lovereading4kids.co.uk/author/1418/Rose-Impey.html",
