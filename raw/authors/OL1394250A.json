    "bio": "Steve Rune Lundin (born October 7, 1959), known as Steven Erikson, is a Canadian novelist best known for his epic fantasy series *Malazan Book of the Fallen*, which follows a complex world of magic, politics, and war. Born in Toronto, Ontario, he grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and trained as an archaeologist and anthropologist. Erikson is a graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop and has worked in various roles before dedicating himself to writing full-time. His works are celebrated for their depth, complexity, and multi-dimensional characters, often challenging traditional fantasy conventions. Erikson's writing is influenced by his background in archaeology and anthropology, as well as his experiences with pen and paper role-playing games.\r\n\r\n(Sources:[1][1],[2][2])\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Erikson\r\n[2]: https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Steven-Erikson/biography.html",
