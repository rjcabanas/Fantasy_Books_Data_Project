        "value": "Salman Rushdie was born in 1947 in Bombay to a Kashmiri family. He won the Booker Prize in 1981. Much of his  fiction is set on the Indian subcontinent. His style is often classified as magical realism mixed with historical fiction, and a dominant theme of his work is the story of the many connections, disruptions and migrations between the Eastern and Western world."
