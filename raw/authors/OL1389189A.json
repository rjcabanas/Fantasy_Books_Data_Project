    "bio": "Blake A. Hoena grew up in central Wisconsin, where, in his youth, he wrote stories about robots conquering the Moon and trolls lumbering around in the woods behind his parents house, and the fact that the trolls were hunting for little boys had nothing to do with Blake\u2019s pesky brothers. Later, he moved to Minnesota to pursue a Masters of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing from Minnesota State University, Mankato.\r\n\r\nSince graduating, Blake has written more than thirty books for children, including retellings of *The Legend of Sleepy Hollow* and the Perseus and Medusa myth. Most recently, he\u2019s working on a series of graphic novels about two space alien brothers, Eek and Ack, who are determined to conquer our big blue home.\r\n\r\n**Source**: [Author's website](http://bahoena.com)",
