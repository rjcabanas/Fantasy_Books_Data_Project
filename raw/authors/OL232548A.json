    "bio": "Julia Donaldson CBE (born Julia Catherine Shields; born 16 September 1948) is an English writer and playwright, and the 2011\u20132013 Children's Laureate. She is best known for her popular rhyming stories for children, especially those illustrated by Axel Scheffler, which include The Gruffalo, Room on the Broom and Stick Man. \r\n\r\nShe originally wrote songs for children's television but has concentrated on writing books since the words of one of her songs, \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", were made into a children's book in 1993. Of her 184 published works, 64 are widely available in bookshops. The remaining 120 are intended for school use and include her Songbirds phonic reading scheme, which is part of the Oxford University Press's Oxford Reading Tree.",
