    "bio": "James Oliver Rigney Jr. (October 17, 1948 \u2013 September 16, 2007), known by his pen name Robert Jordan, was an American author known for his epic fantasy series *The Wheel of Time*. Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Jordan developed a passion for storytelling and served two tours in Vietnam before pursuing a writing career in 1977.\r\n\r\nJordan is best known for *The Wheel of Time*, a sprawling fantasy saga that combines intricate world-building, complex characters, and a richly detailed magic system. The series spans fourteen books and a prequel novel, with the first volume, [*The Eye of the World*][1], published in 1990. The narrative explores themes of prophecy, destiny, and the struggle between good and evil, set in a meticulously crafted world with its own history, cultures, and languages.\r\n\r\nAfter Jordan's passing in 2007, fellow fantasy author [Brandon Sanderson][2] was chosen to complete the series using Jordan's extensive notes and outlines. The final three books were published between 2009 and 2013, bringing the epic saga to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nJordan was one of several writers who contributed to the *Conan the Barbarian* series, with his works considered among the best by fans. He wrote seven Conan novels, and compiled a well-known Conan Chronology.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his fantasy writing, Jordan used various pseudonyms for different genres: Reagan O'Neal for historical novels set during the American Revolution, Jackson O'Reilly for a western novel, and Chang Lung for his dance and theater criticism.\r\n\r\nJordan's ability to create immersive worlds and compelling characters has earned him a dedicated fan base and numerous accolades. His work on *The Wheel of Time* series has sold over 90 million copies worldwide and was adapted into a television series by Amazon Prime Video in 2021.\r\n\r\nHis favorite authors included: [Robert A. Heinlein][7], [John D. MacDonald][8], [Louis L'Amour][9], [Jane Austen][10], [Charles Dickens][11], [Mark Twain][12], and [Montaigne][13].\r\n\r\nFantasy authors he enjoyed included: [Tad Williams][14], [Robert Holdstock][15], [Raymond E. Feist][16], [Janny Wurts][17], [Barry Hughart][18], and [C. S. Friedman][19].\r\n\r\n(Sources:[1][37],[2][38],[3][39])\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n*The Wheel of Time* Series in Order: \r\n 1.
