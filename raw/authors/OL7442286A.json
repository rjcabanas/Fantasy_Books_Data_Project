She has been nominated for the World Fantasy and the Eisner, and has won the Hugo, Sequoyah, Nebula, Alfie, WSFA, Coyotl and Ursa Major awards, as well as a half-dozen Junior Library Guild selections. \r\n\r\nThis is the name she uses when writing things for grown-ups. Her work includes multiple fairy-tale retellings and odd little stories about elves and goblins.\r\n\r\nWhen she is not writing, she is probably out in the garden, trying to make eye contact with butterflies. \r\n\r\n[Source][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.amazon.com/T-Kingfisher/e/B00LBKVU3E?ref=dbs_p_ebk_r00_abau_000000"
