Upon the completion of his schooling, he went on to become an English instructor, with his initial literary specialization being in the area of vampire lore. In his capacity as an educator, he worked to establish the Media and Film Studies department at Blackpool Sixth Form College.[3]\r\n\r\nHis writing career began with the release of a sci-fi book, written under the pen-name of J.K. Haderack. This was followed up by releases under his real name, including his first children's novel, which was in part based upon actual experiences and memories he had as a youth. Additional works were produced to expand that single work into a series of titles tailored primarily at Young Adult and Adult Fiction audiences. The books that he wrote after his first pen-name book were The Wardstone Chronicles.\r\n\r\nDelaney retired from his position as an educator in order to devote his energies to a full-time writing career. He has three children and seven grandchildren.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nJoseph Henri Delaney est un auteur anglais de science fiction et d\u2019Heroic Fantasy, qui fut professeur d\u2019anglais sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en litt\u00e9rature vampirique.
