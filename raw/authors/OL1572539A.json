Most people read them in that order but there's always a few who don't. Many people who read them are teenagers but there's a lot who aren't.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a new series called The Smoke Thieves, which is due to be published in spring 2018 and is definitely fantasy (there will be a map).\r\n\r\nI said I'd never write another trilogy after Half Bad but it seems I lied.\r\n\r\nI live in a village in north-west England."
