    "bio": "E.K. Johnston had several jobs and one vocation before she became a published writer. If she\u2019s learned anything, it\u2019s that things turn out weird sometimes, and there\u2019s not a lot you can do about it. Well, that and how to muscle through awkward fanfic because it\u2019s about a pairing she likes.\r\n\r\nHer books range from contemporary fantasy to fairy-tale reimaginings, from hopeful sci-fi to quiet epics, and from small town Ontario to a galaxy far, far away. She has no plans to rein anything in.",
